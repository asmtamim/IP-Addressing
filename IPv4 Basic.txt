An IP address is a decimal number that defines the routing information of the Internet user. It is a
logical address and it is changeable according to the needs. 

There are 2 version of IP Address right now
1. IPv4 (version 4), which is widely used!
2. IPv6 (version 6) 

Every End-device of a network has a unique address or identity. In Network layer each packet of data
has source address and destination address. IPv4 is 32 bits of those addresses.

➢ 4 octet: 4 x 8 bits = 32 bits
➢ Size: 2^32 = 4294967296 (total IP addresses)
➢ Can be described as Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal
➢ 5 classes: A (0-127), B (128-191), C (192-223), D (224-239), E (240-255)
➢ Range of 1 octet: 2^8 = 256 (0-255)
➢ 2 parts: Network octet (Unchangeable), Host octet (Changeable)

➢ There are 2 addresses not for host use in every Class-
• Network ID (1st address)
• Broadcast ID (Last address)

# 3 Types of Addresses:
1. Network Address: A total network is defined by a network address.
2. Broadcast Address: Broadcast address is the address by which every connected host of a network can be communicated.
3. Host Address: Every host needs its own address to communicate through the network.
